> When you have a hammer everything looks like a nail - [Abraham Maslow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument)

School gives us homework, and they give us the same hammer and nail that they've been handing out to kids for decades, and ask us to hammer away for months on end to make sure we hammer the same way as years past.

Unfortunately, the real world just doesn't work this way.

There are hardly any one-size-fits-all solutions.

Yes, technology is eating the world, but no, it is not yet a solution to every problem.

That's the hard lesson I've been learning through [RiceApps](http://riceapps.org/).

For god's sake, we built [an entire website](https://ftwl2019.herokuapp.com/) for a non-profit client from scratch with a Contentful CMS system built-in, when there exists Squarespace, Wix, Wordpress, Weebly, Webflow, etc.

With what stack? You guessed it! React/Node. Cause that's the hammer we're most familiar with using.

We computer science students want to code away at every problem. We want that sexy ML/AI/blockchain/deeplearning crap wherever possible. If that sounds like you, then you're probably better off doing research and academia than joining industry or doing anything remotely entrepreneurial in spirit.
