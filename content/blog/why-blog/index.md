I'm a college student. Kids my age should be on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter or whatever the hell else is the new thing these days.

Instead, I'm going to commit myself to writing on (at least) a weekly basis.

Just in general, I want to write more English, and less code.

Why blog?

Alex Guzey shared [his reasons](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/), I thought I'd share mine.

1. **It is cathartic**

I used to journal for this same reason.

2. **Writing == Thinking**

I highly recommend reading [Boz's piece](https://boz.com/articles/writing-thinking) on this. I couldn't put it better.

3. **It keeps memory**

I think I'm an overthinker. I think about thinking. I think about what I thought before. Our memories are usually [more foggy than we realize](https://www.businessinsider.com/science-of-false-memories-2017-12), but when I read my journals from a year ago, I have a much clearer idea of who I was, what I was doing, and how I felt about it all.

4. **It could help others**

I'm not special. I'm sure many others have gone through my experiences before me, and many will after me. Shared knowledge compounds. The [invention of paper](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/05/best-revenge-is-your-paper/483671/) changed civilizations because it allowed for accumulated knowledge. A lot of what I'll write about will be inspired by what I wish I could tell my younger self.

5. **English > Python/Java/C/...**

Content appreciates over time. Code depreciates over time.
Just take [pg's essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) for example. His main work on Lisp is largely irrelevant these days. But his writings? Aged like fucking fine wine.

6. **[You only learn when you reflect](https://lethain.com/learn-when-you-reflect/)**

And blogging is an amazing way to reflect.
